# Insta-Mail | Generate Temporary Disposable Email Address

Insta Mail is a Python script designed to facilitate the creation of temporary email addresses and the retrieval of emails sent to those addresses. It leverages the functionality provided by the [1secmail API](https://www.1secmail.com/api/) API to generate email addresses and fetch email messages.

Using this script, you have the option to either generate your own custom email address or have a random email address generated for you. Once an email is received, it is automatically saved in a text file located within the "All Mails" folder.

It's important to note that certain email addresses, such as abuse@domain, webmaster@domain, contact@domain, postmaster@domain, hostmaster@domain, and admin@domain, cannot be accessed for security reasons. However, you are free to utilize all other addresses provided by the 1secmail service.
